  <h2>The Zebra at the Wedding</h2>
    <p class="author">By Bredar Wangari</p>

  <!-- Short preview -->
  <p class="short-text">
    Everyone was already there, or let‚Äôs say, almost everyone. Dressed in elegant black and white, they clinked glasses and smiled for the cameras. The wedding had started. Smooth. Sophisticated. Perfect...
  </p>
  
  <!-- Full story hidden initially -->
  <p class="full-text" style="display: none;">
    Until it wasn‚Äôt.

    There was a moment of silence, one of those in-between breaths when she walked in.  
    A young lady in a zebra-print outfit.

    She walked in like a myth. Striped in defiance, smiling in ruins.  
    When it came to dressing, she understood the dress code. She didn‚Äôt come here to play.

    She was tall, dark, dripping supermodel energy.  
    Her heels echoed like drumbeats on marble.  
    She didn‚Äôt whisper. She didn‚Äôt greet.  
    She sat in the back, alone, hat low over her face.  
    Still, the wedding was never the same again.

    The bride leaned toward her bridesmaid.  
    ‚ÄúWho invited the zebra?‚Äù  
    ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ probably one of those people who show up uninvited.‚Äù

    In a way, she was right.  
    No one invited her. But everyone saw her.

    The ceremony went on ‚Äî barely.  
    Eyes darted, whispers swirled.  
    But the zebra never moved. Never spoke.

    Then came the end.

    The guests began to leave.  
    And the paparazzi swarmed‚Ä¶ but not around the bride. Not the groom.

    All cameras turned to the girl in stripes.

    They asked who she was, and she told them.  
    Told them everything.

    How the bride, once her best friend, had stolen her boyfriend.  
    How she found out about the wedding from a gossip page.  
    How she walked in with silence and stripes, not for revenge, but for closure.

    By the time the bride and groom realized what was happening, half the guests were already gone. Some didn‚Äôt even say goodbye.

    The headlines that night were loud and clear:  
    ‚ÄúTHE ZEBRA GIRL AT THE WEDDING.‚Äù

    Her face uncovered.  
    Her truth unveiled.

    And the bride? Ashamed. Labeled a boyfriend snatcher. The wedding, now trending as the worst ever.

    Days passed.  
    The shame wouldn‚Äôt fade.  
    They couldn‚Äôt silence the tweets, the TikToks, the threads.

    Eventually, they had no choice but to come clean.  
    They invited the zebra girl. And apologized, in public.

    But the internet never forgets.  
    And neither did she.

  <h3>I Didn't Know She Was My Biological Mum</h3>
  <p class="author">By Bredar Wangari</p>

  <!-- first paragraph visible -->
  <p class="story-intro">
... inside her house was a family portrait, she looked so happy on the picture but looked so sad in real life. There was also an old calendar of 2002, in the calendar, 8th March was marked with a red pen. She came with two glasses of wine, one for me and the other one for her. We shared some talks, and she seemed like she was forcing herself to laugh.

  <div class="story-extra" aria-hidden="true">
    <p>
She noticed the curiosity in my face and told me, "I can see there's something on your mind, you're free to ask."  
"Why do you look so sad?" I asked.  
She glared at the portrait and then at the calendar, her eyes watery.  
"You see... That portrait, that's my husband, my daughter, and I. That date marked on the calendar was supposed to be my best day ever, my first birthday to celebrate with my husband and daughter. We were driving towards town to an unknown place, listening to soft music, when suddenly‚Ä¶ an accident happened. My daughter died on the spot, and my husband didn‚Äôt make it either. From that day, I became a shipwrecked woman with no one to care for. So you see‚Ä¶ that day, I'll never forget it."
    </p>

    <p>
I felt sorry for her. At 25, she was already a widow and had lost a child. I offered her a shoulder to cry on and kept telling her it would be okay. To console her differently, I began reading a book aloud. She started laughing ‚Äî thank goodness, this is what I wanted.
    </p>

    <p>
"Didn't you consider remarrying? I mean, it's 22 years since that happened, you deserve happiness," I asked.  
She glared at me, tears in her eyes, "My daughter‚Ä¶ I loved my family so much, I couldn't replace it. But the real reason‚Ä¶ after the accident, my womb was damaged. The doctor told me I would never bear children again. That was the saddest thing in my life, so I didn‚Äôt see a reason to remarry."  
</p>

    <p>
She continued, "Everything happens for a reason, but sometimes I ask, why me? I wish my other daughter hadn‚Äôt died at birth."  
I interrupted, "Wait‚Ä¶ you had another daughter?"  
"Yes," she said, "I gave birth to twins, but one didn‚Äôt make it. You remind me so much of them."  
</p>

    <p>
I asked, "When were they born?"  
"2nd of February 2002," she replied. My mind raced. Why would we share a birthday? Could it be‚Ä¶ a hospital mix-up? I suggested a DNA test to clear my doubts. She agreed.
    </p>

    <p>
We went to the hospital and waited a week for results. On the day, she saw the results, covered her mouth, and tears of joy fell. She hugged me tightly and shouted, "Welcome back, my daughter! I can't believe I've always thought you were dead, thanks for coming back to my rescue."  
I cried too. "Thank you for being my mother. I won't leave you, mum, till infinity‚Ä¶ AND BEYOND."

  <h3>Chronicles of Queen Bee and Mimi 1</h3>
  <p class="author">By Bredar Wangari</p>

  <!-- First visible intro -->
  <p class="story-intro">
    Hey there! My name is Bee ‚Äî but around here, they call me Queen Bee. I‚Äôm 23,
    a proud cat lover, and a software developer by trade. My life? A whole lot
    of tech, and a whole lot of feline drama. And of course, I don‚Äôt live alone
    ‚Äî I share my space with Mimi, my sassy, snuggly, four-pawed princess...

    <h4>Meet Queen Bee and Mimi</h4>
    <p>
      Mimi isn‚Äôt just a cat ‚Äî she‚Äôs my little princess. Our relationship is equal
      parts chaos and cuddles. She keeps me company, makes me laugh, and brightens
      even the dullest of debugging days. Working remotely as a developer means
      I‚Äôm home most of the time, and honestly, that‚Äôs been the best thing for both
      of us.
    </p>

    <p>
      She‚Äôs a snob when she wants to be, a bully when she‚Äôs bored, but always full
      of affection when I need it most. She knows when I‚Äôm sad and leans against
      my shoulder, her soft fur comforting me more than any words could. And yes ‚Äî
      she has her own cat bed, but somehow always ends up in mine.
    </p>

    <h4>Life as a Remote Worker and Cat Mama</h4>
    <p>
      People think working from home is easy. A friend once told me it‚Äôs ‚Äújust
      chilling and waiting for payment.‚Äù But being a software developer is no
      joke. Coding is fun, but it‚Äôs demanding. And being a cat mum? That requires
      patience, empathy, and learning to read a language with no words.
    </p>

    <p>
      My mornings usually start with coffee at 9 a.m., while Mimi enjoys her
      second breakfast of the day ‚Äî a soft life, right? She‚Äôs disciplined too,
      always sensing when it‚Äôs mealtime. Once the princess is served, I get back
      to debugging until noon. After that, the afternoons are ours: playtime,
      cuddles, and mood swings galore.
    </p>

    <p>
      This rhythm ‚Äî code, coffee, cuddles ‚Äî makes me grateful every day. Being a
      software engineer and a cat mum at the same time feels like living two dream
      lives at once.

  <h3>House of Secrets</h3>
  <p class="author">By Bredar Wangari</p>

  <!-- First visible intro -->
  <p class="story-intro">
    Everyone hides under a mask. My name is Julian, but everyone calls me Julie. 
    I have a big sister, Elliana ‚Äî Elle for short ‚Äî and if you knew her, you‚Äôd know 
    she‚Äôs the perfect proof that you can never judge a book by its cover...

    <h4>House of Secrets</h4>
    <p>
      Elle styles me, nags me, and protects me like I‚Äôm made of glass. She wanted to be an artist once; 
      Mum told her she sounded more like Kamau than Beyonc√©. Elle never quite healed from that, 
      but she knows how to sew confidence into clothes.
    </p>

    <p>
      My best friend is Benita ‚Äî the one I tell everything to. My ex is Rommy. Don‚Äôt ask about Rommy. 
      He once said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll never find someone else like me.‚Äù Joke was on him; I wouldn‚Äôt want someone like that again.
    </p>

    <p>
      I woke up in a brilliant mood. Two classes: eight a.m. and two p.m. I never miss morning lectures ‚Äî 
      Elle drops me on her way to work ‚Äî but afternoons are negotiable. Benita always signs attendance for me when I skip. 
      Guess which one I‚Äôd miss? If you said the two p.m., you‚Äôre right.
    </p>

    <p>
      Elle fussed as usual. She was all dressed and ready; I‚Äôd barely finished breakfast when she threatened to leave me. 
      She never really does. She‚Äôs overly protective, the kind who checks the lock twice and tucks the scarf into place. 
      She said she‚Äôd be back by five; I lied and told her I‚Äôd stay until four. Truth was, I‚Äôd only go to one lecture and nap the rest of the day.
    </p>

    <p>
      Benita waited for me at the computer hub. She was buzzing about a party that night at Apartment K. 
      As she talked, a handsome guy walked by and winked. ‚ÄúWho is he?‚Äù I asked, distracted. 
      ‚ÄúHave you been listening?‚Äù Benita rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúParty. Details. Tonight.‚Äù
    </p>

    <p>
      We went to class and sat at the back. The handsome guy sat beside me, introduced himself as Miles, 
      and took my number. He said he‚Äôd be at Apartment K. I said I would too ‚Äî convincing Elle would be the hard part.
    </p>

    <p>
      After class Benita cornered me like a worry that wouldn‚Äôt go away. ‚ÄúIs this what you want?‚Äù she asked. 
      I said we were just friends; Benita‚Äôs tone made it clear she didn‚Äôt buy it. Miles found us then. 
      ‚ÄúHi Benita‚Äîcan I steal your friend a little?‚Äù he asked. Benita nodded and let us walk. 
      I liked Miles. He was nothing like Rommy: gentle, easy, and real. For a minute I dared to imagine more.
    </p>

    <p>
      That night Elle made me promise to call by ten. She would drive me there and pick me up; I‚Äôd be home by ten. 
      She left for a date with Jake ‚Äî her boyfriend who calls me ‚Äúlastie‚Äù ‚Äî and I went to the party.
    </p>

    <p>
      Miles was there. We danced, ate, I drank wine ‚Äî not last-ditch, just wine. 
      When the party ended Miles left with his friends in his car; I went home and slept like nothing had changed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Morning brought the news ‚Äî a crash on the bypass. My stomach clenched: Miles. I called Benita; she was safe. 
      Miles didn‚Äôt answer. At school the rumor spread: Miles had broken his hand in the accident. 
      He called later, voice thin and nervous; I promised to visit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then the betrayal landed like a slap. I saw Benita talking to Rommy. I eavesdropped until I heard enough: 
      Rommy had orchestrated the crash. Benita had been part of it. Why? Blackmail. 
      Secrets are weighty, and Benita knew the things I kept hidden from Elle. She threatened to tell.
    </p>

    <p>
      When she saw me she tried to smile. ‚ÄúDid you hear anything?‚Äù she asked. I told Miles everything. 
      Benita held the threat like a club: reveal Julie‚Äôs secrets to Elle, or suffer the consequences. 
      I cut her off. I broke things with Benita that day. I hated her ‚Äî and Rommy ‚Äî the heat of betrayal burning hotter than any heartbreak.
    </p>

    <p>
      I went to Miles‚Äô house instead. He was bruised but whole. He told me he loved me; I told him to heal first. 
      We were careful with words. ‚ÄúFriends,‚Äù we said, but my hand found his, and sometimes hands speak truer than promises.
    </p>

    <p>
      I got home to find Elle waiting on the couch, a grin that didn‚Äôt match the way she‚Äôd been walking. 
      ‚ÄúI have a confession,‚Äù she said. My nerves jumped. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù
    </p>

    <p>
      She stood and laughed like she‚Äôd been holding a secret too long. ‚ÄúI am the Masked Girl.‚Äù 
      My breath left me. The Masked Girl ‚Äî the singer I played on repeat, the one no one had ever seen without a mask ‚Äî was Elle? 
      She‚Äôd been hiding behind glitter and a smile, and tonight she planned to take it all off.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sixty faces. Forty masks. Everyone hiding something. I thought of Benita and Rommy, of Miles‚Äô blood and my secrets like bones in a drawer. 
      Suddenly the city felt smaller, every secret connected, the neighborhood a house of masks.
    </p>

    <p>
      ‚ÄúEveryone is hiding under the mask?‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Elle said. ‚ÄúBut not everyone is ready to take theirs off.‚Äù
    </p>

    <p>
      And in that quiet, I realized the worst of the betrayals hadn‚Äôt been Rommy‚Äôs plotting. 
      It was the small, ordinary silences we call choosing: the ones we keep to protect ourselves. 
      Tonight, masks would fall ‚Äî whether we liked it or not.
    </p>
