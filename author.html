    <h2>Meet the Author</h2>
    <img src="images/slide3.jpeg" alt="Author Photo" class="author-photo" />
    <p>
      Hi, I’m <strong>Bredar Wangari</strong>, also known as <em>Wangari Bree or you can call me BreezyBee</em> 🐝.  
      I’m the creator of <strong>BeeVerse Tales</strong> — a planet where stories, poems,  
      research, and creativity come alive. Writing is not just my passion,  
      it’s the way I breathe life into thoughts, laughter, and dreams.  
    </p>
    <p>
      From heartfelt poetry to humorous pranks, from creative stories to research,  
      BeeVerse Tales is my canvas. I hope you’ll explore, enjoy, and maybe even  
      submit your own spark of imagination ✨.
    </p>

  <!-- Introduction Section -->

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <img src="images/slide5.jpeg" alt="Mimi the Cat" class="author-photo" />
    <p>
      I’m a writer, web developer, book editor,  
      and proud cat mom. My partner in creativity is <strong>Mimi</strong>,  
      a fluffy ball of sunshine who believes she runs this place (and honestly, she does 😸).

  <h2>My Writing Journey</h2>
  <img src="images/slide6.jpeg" alt="Bree outdoors" class="author-photo" />
  <p>
    If I’m not writing, you’ll probably find me outdoors 🌿, soaking in the beauty of nature.  
    Watching the trees sway, listening to birds, or just breathing in fresh air  
    feels so therapeutic — and it often sparks feelings I never knew I had ✨.  
  </p>
  <p>
    I value mental health deeply, and that’s one of the reasons I also write self-help articles.  
    For me, writing isn’t just words — it’s healing, discovery, and connection.  
  </p>

<!-- Beyond Writing Section -->
<section class="author-section">
  <h2>Beyond Writing</h2>
  <img src="images/slide8.jpeg" alt="Fashion and style" class="author-photo" />
  <p>
    I’m also a huge lover of fashion 👗✨. If I’m not writing, editing,  
    or working on a project, you’ll probably catch me designing outfits  
    and making sure they look <em>k-ute</em> 💅.  
  </p>
  <p>
    Funny thing — I once dreamed of being a model, but life had other plans.  
    Instead of the runway, I found myself in the library 📚,  
    where I studied <strong>Information Science</strong> in campus.  
    Maybe not the catwalk, but definitely a path that shaped my creative journey.  
  </p>

<!-- Creative Roots Section -->
<section class="author-section">
  <h2>Creative Roots</h2>
  <img src="images/slide9.jpeg" alt="Drama and storytelling" class="author-photo" />
  <p>
    Back in high school, I was into drama 🎭 — but let’s just say music and I  
    didn’t exactly get along. I got kicked out of music because of my two left legs  
    that refused to dance 💃😂.  
  </p>
  <p>
    Truth is, I almost made it — just slightly. My voice was never meant for singing,  
    but I’m a <em>terrific</em> bathroom singer and an even better solo dancer.  
    When I step outside, though, my voice finds its real home in poetry and storytelling.  
  </p>
  <p>
    My brothers used to tease that I “speak with my nose,” but honestly,  
    I think I have a pretty sweet voice — one made for words, laughter, and tales.  
  </p>
</section>
<!-- Writing Journey Section -->
<section class="author-section">
  <h2>How My Writing Journey Began</h2>
  <img src="images/slide7.jpeg" alt="Writing journey" class="author-photo" />
  <p>
    As a kid, I was that child who pressured her parents to buy storybooks 📚.  
    Ask me about any childhood book and I could tell you exactly which shelf it sat on.  
    At night, my mum told me tales — and I loved trickster narratives the most.  
    Maybe that’s where the <strong>Prankster Queen</strong> in me was born 👑😂.  
  </p>
  <p>
    I still remember pranking my brother with a fake sweet — he fell for it, of course!  
    Speaking of family, I’m the only girl, the lastborn, with two older brothers.  
    Can you believe that? The chaos and the comedy write themselves.  
  </p>
  <p>
    I also adored ogre tales — they were my childhood horror movies.  
    I’d dream of being chased by ogres, terrified but fascinated all the same 👹.  
  </p>
  <p>
    Back in 2011, when I was in class four, I started writing little scripts.  
    Inspired by my <em>New Progressive Primary English Book</em>,  
    they were “for my eyes only,” but to me they felt like masterpieces.  
    Then in class eight (2015), I wrote my very first poem — about smoking —  
    pulling ideas from what I saw in class.  
  </p>
  <p>
    From there, writing became a lifelong companion.  
    By 2021 in campus, I finally started sharing my poems publicly.  
    That’s also when I landed my first editing gig, thanks to Joseph Thiong’o’s  
    <em>Love Poems Inspired by a Friend</em>. He believed in me,  
    and that belief gave me wings ✨.  
  </p>
  <p>
    My journey continues — and so can yours.  
    I hope you’ll find a spark of motivation here in BeeVerse Tales 💛.
