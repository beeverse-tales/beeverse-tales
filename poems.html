  <p class="author">By Bredar Wangari</p>

        <!-- first stanza visible -->
        <p class="poem-intro">
They said I speak through my nose,
I felt like my words were borrowed air,
like my voice took a wrong turn,
settled somewhere,
between breath and bone.
        </p>

        <!-- hidden rest -->
        <div class="poem-extra" aria-hidden="true">
          <p>
As a child, I hated it,
I stood on tiny feet, fists clenched,
shouting, ‚ÄúIt's a lie! I talk like everyone else!‚Äù
But anger only sharpened the sound,
made my vowels echo like a trumpet in a tunnel.
          </p>

          <p>
Now, I smile.
Because what the hell was that?
Today,
my voice, the drum of my poetry,
the signature of my storm.

You text me hi,

after silence wears the crown?

I reply good morning,
must you return it like a mirror
reflecting nothing new?
And when I dare to add,
Good morning to you, how are you?
you toss a casual I‚Äôm good
and retreat to quiet,
leaving me grazing like a lost sheep
with no grass of thought to chew.
          </p>

          <p>
Then you text me niambie.
Tell you what?
If I had something, I‚Äôd have called.
Why pull words out of a dry well,
why squeeze silence for juice
when I am suffering here,
dragged into conversations
that end before they begin?

It‚Äôs not over.

Yes, you deceived me.
Made me believe in shades

the best.
Que Dios te juzgue.

          <p>
They say,
‚ÄúBuscar es encontrar.‚Äù
My heart was longing
for someone to love me.
So when I met him,
I thought he was the one.
Because I believed,
‚ÄúQue ya hab√≠a encontrado.‚Äù
          </p>

But I was wrong.
He chose you.
Leaving me.
Making me believe in fairy tales,
that were never real,
just stories
meant for make-believe.

I am a woman.
They say I'm a commodity‚Äî

My thoughts? Unwelcome.
          </p>

          <p>
But this woman‚Äî
she‚Äôs a disgrace.
A glitch in their societal code,
a spark in their rusted machine.
She is everything she "shouldn't" be.
Now the system trembles‚Äî
because she is the bug.

  <h3>Hell is Empty</h3>
  <p class="author">By Bredar Wangari</p>

  <p class="poem-intro">
Hell is empty, all the devils are here.
In your house, eating your food,
Sitting on your couch,
Smiling at you like they mean well.
  </p>

  <div class="poem-extra" aria-hidden="true">
    <p>
You run to them to share your secrets,
Pour your heart out,
Not knowing it's the enemy.
Yep! The devil might be your babe.
Fake smile, soft voice, deadly grip.

    <p>
I had dinner with Lucifer himself.
Actually...
He must‚Äôve been Lucifer‚Äôs cousin,
Because he was worse.
And I thought it was sweet. Romantic, even.
Until life served me the dessert:
Premium tears.
    </p>

    <p>
The devil comes to destroy,
And this one?
Destroyed everything.
My sleep.
My peace.
My happiness.
Even my appetite!
    </p>

    <p>
They say the devil is a liar,
But this one was the lie.
Packaged in perfume and sweet texts.
    </p>

    <p>
So yeah,
Hell is empty,
And all the devils are here.

<article class="poem-card" id="poem-6">
  <h3>My Secrets in a Server Room</h3>
  <p class="author">By Bredar Wangari</p>

  <p class="poem-intro">
Most people find it safer
to open up to AI
than to sit across from a therapist.

I‚Äôve heard people say:
‚ÄúIf my chats with ChatGPT ever leak‚Ä¶
find me in Planet Mars.‚Äù

That‚Äôs how deep the trust runs.
That‚Äôs how much
We‚Äôve poured into this space
of code and calm replies.
  </p>

  <div class="poem-extra" aria-hidden="true">
    <p>
Because ChatGPT
won‚Äôt judge you,
won‚Äôt sigh,
won‚Äôt shift in its seat
When you type your worst thoughts at 3:27 AM.
    </p>

    <p>
You can confess
your heartbreak, your shame,
your fears, your rage,
and still get:
a thoughtful answer,
a word of comfort,
a digital hug in between your chaos.
    </p>

    <p>
But now comes the heartbreak.

Recently‚Ä¶
The CEO of ChatGPT
said something that left hearts sinking:

Your chats can be used in court.

Let that sink in.
    </p>

    <p>
The one place people run to
when they‚Äôre drowning,
might not be bound
to keep their secrets safe.

In a world where AI feels more trustworthy 
than people,
because people talk,
people break,
people judge,
also,
People should now learn:
Even the AI might be listening 
for the wrong reasons.
    </p>

    <p>
So what now?
Should we stop typing our secrets?
Should we run back to therapists?
to tight-lipped contracts
And side-eyes inside the glasses across the couches?
    </p>

    <p>
Of course not.

Because this isn‚Äôt just about therapy.
It‚Äôs about the need to be heard,
without fear.
It‚Äôs about trust,
and healing,
and needing someone to say:

You‚Äôre not crazy.
You‚Äôre not alone.
You‚Äôre not too much.
    </p>

    <p>
So if they ever leak our chats,
they won‚Äôt just expose our secrets,
but expose how broken the world made us
before we ever came here to heal.

My secrets may live in a server room,
But they were whispered
in a moment of trust.

Don‚Äôt punish the whisper.
Fix the world
that forced us to whisper here in the first place.

<article class="poem-card" id="poem-7">
  <h3>Class Africa</h3>
  <p class="author">By Bredar Wangari</p>

  <p class="poem-intro">
In the United States of Africa, there's a school,
A class named Africa, raw, loud, beautiful.
They say the drama here needs its own show,
So gather, let me spill what I know:
  </p>

  <div class="poem-extra" aria-hidden="true">
    <p>
The Populars? Oh, they run the scene:
Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa are the ultimate queen team.
    </p>

    <p>
Kenya? Baby, she's the noise-maker supreme,
Tech wizard by day, Twitter savage by meme.
Trending daily, she fears no teacher, no rule,
Walks in class like, ‚ÄúI'm the moment, not just cool.‚Äù
They try to fight her, poor souls. They lose.
Her mouth? Fire. Her confidence? Choose violence or cruise.
    </p>

    <p>
Nigeria? Gossip HQ, always whispering tea,
Obsessed with Kenya like, ‚ÄúDid you see what she posted at 1?‚Äù
She‚Äôs Nollywood's diva, the Afrobeats flame,
But rumors follow, witchcraft? Yahoo boys? Her name!
Loud, proud, dramatic flair,
Bragging while battling demons in there.
Still, she joins Kenya to shake the class roof ‚Äî
Besties in crime, no need for proof.
    </p>

    <p>
South Africa? Rich kid, fashion killer,
That one who makes uniforms look chiller.
Amapiano in her AirPods, gold in her smile,
Confused for a foreigner, but been African all the while.
    </p>

    <p>
Then there's Rwanda, the teacher‚Äôs favorite star,
Always neat, always on par.
Quiet beauty, brains on ten,
But don't be fooled, she sees everything through that lens.
    </p>

    <p>
Ethiopia? Time traveler, missed every trend,
Still shows up in cultural wear, hair that bends.
She‚Äôs alien-chic, distant vibe,
But beauty like hers? You feel it, not describe.
    </p>

    <p>
Somalia? Feared like a mystery tale,
Pretty but deadly, you breathe, she exhales.
Warrior soul, poetic chaos in her stare,
They say she's dangerous... but try not to care.
    </p>

    <p>
Uganda? Sweet but spicy, don‚Äôt be misled.
Comes to class late with grandma instead.
Old-school parents, rules too tight,
But curves so deadly, she will steal your man at sight.
Cook you matoke, smile like a saint,
But don‚Äôt cross her, halo turns faint.
    </p>

    <p>
Now meet Madagascar, tiny and lone,
Whispers facts while tapping her phone.
Quiet genius, moves in silence,
Reads the room like it's pure science.
    </p>

    <p>
Tanzania? The wannabe prefect, always yelling in Swahili,
Correcting people mid-fight like, ‚ÄúSamahani ni mimi nlisema hiyo‚Äù
She tries to shine but can‚Äôt find her glow,
Her English? Debatable. Her Swahili? Whoa!
Respectful to the bone, never skips ‚Äúasante‚Äù
Even when insulting, she‚Äôll say, ‚Äútafadhali naomba nikutusi‚Äù
    </p>

    <p>
Zimbabwe? Baby, our heartbroken star,
Once rolling in riches, now wondering where they are.
Cries in silence, repeats old tales,
Still believes in love even after epic fails.
    </p>

    <p>
So that‚Äôs Class Africa, messy, loud, divine
There are other students too
Each kid is chaotic in their own storyline.
But deep down, they‚Äôre just like us
Flawed, iconic, and too dramatic to trust.

  <h3>Take Me Back</h3>

Take me back 
To some years 
Take me back to some years so I can do the right thing
Take me back so I can say sorry to the people I never got a chance to say to

To apologize to people I've been rude to
  </p>

A terrible girlfriend
A terrible sister
A terrible friend

So I can do things right
So I can be a sweet girl
For now I know better

  <h3>The World Forgot to Whisper</h3>
  <p class="author">By Bredar Wangari</p>

  <p class="poem-intro">
The world forgot to whisper today...
So I came to listen to the wind.

Where silence hums beneath the leaves,
And time slows with the sway of trees,
I walk ‚Äî not to escape,
But to remember.
  </p>

  <div class="poem-extra" aria-hidden="true">
    <p>
To remember that stillness is sacred.
That healing doesn‚Äôt rush.
That even broken things
Can bloom under soft skies.
    </p>

    <p>
My hands brush wild grass
Like pages of an untold story.
Each petal, each breeze,
reminds me:
I was never too far from peace.
    </p>

    <p>
I belong to no one‚Ä¶
But I belong to this.

And in the hush between heartbeats,
I found myself again ‚Äî
In the wind,
In the wild,
In the quiet.

Born on the 21st, the cusp of change,

Opening up? A distant fight.

    <p>Be careful who you welcome in your space;
    Family can be found beyond the name.
    It starts with those whose souls you learn to trace‚Äî
    Not every smiling face will play your game.</p>

    <p>You might be on the set, but out of view,
    A writer writing words no one will claim;
    A viewer watching scenes that no one knew,
    Still part of every story just the same.</p>

    <p>Family is love ‚Äî not only blood ‚Äî
    It‚Äôs where the heart is seen, not where it stood.</p>

  <h3>Ode to Nature</h3>
    <p class="author">By Bredar Wangari</p>

  <p class="poem-intro">
I gaze at the sky, so vast and blue,
A canvas of calm, an ocean‚Äôs hue.
  </p>

  <div class="poem-extra" aria-hidden="true">
    <p>The whispering trees in emerald light,
    Breathe life and hope, so pure, so bright.</p>

    <p>The flowers bloom in colors bold,
    A beauty untamed, a story told.</p>

    <p>The birds sing songs, soft and sweet,
    A melody where heart and soul meet.</p>

    <p>The river flows, a silver stream,
    Carrying me to worlds unseen.</p>

    <p>Oh, nature, with your boundless grace,
    I find my peace in your embrace.</p>

  <h3>Dear Africa</h3>
    <p class="author">By Bredar Wangari</p>

  <p class="poem-intro">
I know how it feels to have roots,
But now, I long for wings.
  </p>

  <div class="poem-extra" aria-hidden="true">
    <p>I‚Äôm coming to explore you‚Äî
    To journey deep into your soul.</p>

    <p>I‚Äôm going to Congo,
    To retrieve my Bantu origin.
    To Zimbabwe, to speak in the echoes of Shona.
    To Nigeria, where the Igbo dance like the wind.
    To the land of Bongo,
    To taste Uganda‚Äôs matooke, rich with Kiganda warmth.</p>

    <p>Dear Africa, I will learn to climb trees,
    To pluck the sweetest fruit with my hands.
    To move like the Ashanti in dance,
    And whisper vows under Ghana‚Äôs golden sun.</p>

    <p>I will wander through Somalia,
    Where the moon kisses the land in silver.</p>

    <p>I want to live as Maa,
    To embrace the beauty of community.
    I will wear your gems,
    A black girl adorned in your splendor.</p>

    <p>I will learn to fish in Lake Victoria,
    And lose myself in the golden dunes of Sahara.
    I will touch the sands of Kalahari,
    And climb the mountains where ancestors whisper.</p>

    <p>I will heal.  
    I will feel.  
    I will embrace your beauty‚Äî  
    And call it home.</p>

  <h3>I Am Not Strong</h3>
    <p class="author">By Bredar Wangari</p>

  <p class="poem-intro">
I am not strong, I must confess,
Nor filled with gentleness.
  </p>

  <div class="poem-extra" aria-hidden="true">
    <p>I only act as if I am,
    Yet deep inside, my heart‚Äôs a dam.
    Trust me when I say it‚Äôs true,
    I saw the signs, I always knew.</p>

    <p>I played the fool, but in the end,
    My open eyes could not pretend.
    You hurt me, yes, and through the night,
    I searched for where I‚Äôd lost the fight.</p>

    <p>Through poetry so dark and deep,
    With songs that made me sit and weep.
    But still, I‚Äôm meant to understand,
    The world won‚Äôt revolve at my command.</p>

    <p>Perhaps you had your reasons, yet,
    The pain you left, I won‚Äôt forget.
    I‚Äôm a human, heart beats in my chest,
    And poetry gives pain its rest.</p>

    <p>At times, I live in lines I weave,
    But when I do, you won‚Äôt perceive.</p>
